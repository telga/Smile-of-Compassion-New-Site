# New Smile of Compassion Site

Link to gh-page test site: [https://telga.github.io/Smile-of-Compassion-New-Site](https://telga.github.io/Smile-of-Compassion-New-Site)

New redesigned site for Smile of Compassion Projects using React and Hygraph as a CMS.

(Please note this is a work in progress and not all the content is migrated yet and some features may not work. This is by no means what the final site will look like but just a skeleton in progress. All styles are placeholders and will change. The site is not responsive at this point and is only intended to show the current progress and functionality.)
