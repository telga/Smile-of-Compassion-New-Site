Link to gh-page test site: [https://telga.github.io/Smile-of-Compassion-New-Site](https://telga.github.io/Smile-of-Compassion-New-Site)

New redesigned site for Smile of Compassion Projects using React and Hygraph as a CMS.

## Features:
- Uses Hygraph CMS to allow admin to add posts by entering data in a user-friendly interface, no code involved.
- All added pages on Hygraph will be appended to main site immediately.
- Language switcher is setup for local static translations on non-dynamic pages but dynamic pages is done through Hygraph locales (currently EN and VN).

## Roadmap:

- [ ] Content migration.
- [ ] Contact form backend.
- [ ] Full stylization.

(Please note this is a work in progress and not all the content is migrated yet and some features may not work. This is by no means what the final site will look like but just a skeleton in progress. All styles are placeholders and will change. The site is not responsive at this point and is only intended to show the current progress and functionality.)
